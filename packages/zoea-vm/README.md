# zoea-vm

VM creation, management, and deployment tools for Zoea Collab: Agent Cowork Toolkit.

## Status

**Placeholder Package** - Scope to be defined.

## Background

Currently using [exe.dev](https://exe.dev) for VM deployment. This package will be created after evaluating the exe.dev workflow and identifying deployment patterns that would benefit from automation.

## Potential Future Scope

- VM provisioning and configuration
- Deployment automation
- Environment management
- Infrastructure as code templates

## Development

This package is intentionally minimal. Requirements will be defined based on:

1. Patterns identified from exe.dev usage
2. Common deployment workflows
3. Infrastructure automation needs

## Contributing

Before adding functionality to this package, please:

1. Document the use case
2. Evaluate if existing tools (exe.dev CLI, Terraform, etc.) already cover the need
3. Propose the API/CLI interface in an issue
