# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical planning documents and implementation notes that have been completed or superseded by newer documentation.

## Contents

### Implementation Plans (Completed)

- **DJANGO_ORGANIZATIONS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Original implementation plan for django-organizations integration (completed)
- **ORGANIZATIONS_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of organization integration work (completed)

These documents are now superseded by:
- [Multi-Tenant Architecture Guide](../architecture/multi-tenant.md)
- [Backend Architecture](../architecture/backend.md)

### Design Notes (Historical)

- **graphologue-notes.txt** - Early design notes for the Graphologue diagram system
- **FOLDER-MODEL-PLAN.txt** - Planning notes for folder/model organization

These represent early brainstorming and design thinking. The actual implementations may differ from these notes as the project evolved.

## Why Archive?

These documents are preserved for historical reference but are no longer part of the active documentation. They provide context for design decisions and show the evolution of the project's architecture.
